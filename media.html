    <p id = "media-information">This one is simple, Phineas and Ferb is an undeniable classic that will
        be talked about for generations. When I heard they were doing more episodes, I assumed it was 
        fake, but when I found out it was real, I was estatic. So many great memories have been created
        from things relating to this show, and its movies. I have watched the entire show through About
        4 or 5 times, and it's amazing every time. It simply brings me back to a time where my 
        biggest worry was what time I went to bed. Simply amazing
